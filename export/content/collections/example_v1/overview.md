# Welcome!

[TOC]

## Intro
A full example has been set up for you, so you can see how to use Dok. You can delete them and create your own or keep them around for reference. Totally up to you. Any collection, navigation, or any other content beginning with `example` you can safely delete.

## Example files
The below is a comprehensive list of all example files that come included in this Starter Kit. You can delete these or keep them around for reference.

```
content/collections/example_v1
content/collections/releases/example_v1.md
content/collections/example_v1.yaml
content/navigation/example_v1.yaml
content/trees/navigation/example_v1.yaml
```

You may need to refresh the stache after doing this:
```shell
php please stache:refresh
```
