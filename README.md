## Projects & Versions
Host unlimited projects and manage unlimited releases for each project. Easily create new projects or releases with a simple `dok:create:project` or `dok:create:release` command.

## Markdown
Some of the best features of Dok are in its flexible Markdown authoring features.

Alongside the components and extensions Dok ships with, it also includes a powerful feature called Component Binding. This allows you to use entirely new components directly in Markdown—without ever needing to create a CommonMark extension. With nothing more than a simple configuration change and a Blade file, you’re good to go.

Dok ships with:

- **Code Group Extension**

    The Code Group extension transforms your code blocks. Includes dynamic features like custom titles, collapsible blocks, tabbed content, and a copy code button. You can even control the markup by editing the Blade file!

- **Table Wrapping**

    We all know tables are not fun to work with. This extension wraps your tables in a little extra markup, making tables that little bit better to style again.

- **Lead Text**

    Lead text for (usually) below your main heading.

- **Hints**

    Add note, tip, important, caution, warning hints to your Markdown.

- **Cards**

    Add a simple card for navigation, or to just highlight some stuff a bit differently.

- **Accordion**

    Just like the musical instrument, it folds.
